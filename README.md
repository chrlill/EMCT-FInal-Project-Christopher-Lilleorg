# Friction(less) - BSc Electronic Music, Computing and Technology 2025 - Final Project by Christopher Lilleorg

Goldsmiths, University of London

Instructed by Charles Hutchins

Student ID: 33772935

Date: June 2nd, 2025


# Project Overview


Friction(less) is an interactive audio-visual installation that combines live sound synthesis and real-time AI-generated imagery. This project integrates Max/MSP with the FluCoMa and ODOT packages for audio synthesis, and TouchDesigner with the custom StreamDiffusionTD component by DotSimulate for the visuals.

This installation is normally controlled with a touchscreen interface, but the code for this version has been adjusted to enable mouse controls.

# Hardware Requirements

Windows 10 or 11

NVIDIA GPU (for CUDA support)

# Setup Instructions


## Audio Setup in Max/MSP and TouchDesigner

Connect the audio output from Max/MSP to the Audio Device In operator in TouchDesigner using an audio routing software (such as [VB-Audio Matrix](https://vb-audio.com/Matrix/) on Windows). 

Set the audio output device in the Audio Device Out operator to hear sound output.

## Load and Slice Samples in Max/MSP

Open the Max/MSP patch and connect the synthesizer to the path of the provided sample folder.

To load and slice the samples, click on the message box containing the file path.

Start the Drone2.flac file and set it to play on loop in Max/MSP.

## Visual Setup in TouchDesigner

Open the TouchDesigner project.

Set up the StreamDiffusionTD component as per the provided instructions by DotSimulate. Select sd-turbo as the base model and the provided custom LoRa as the fine-tuning model.

Click on the Window operator within the project file. Open the project in Presentation mode. 

## Interaction


Press 5 on the keyboard to start the introductory sequence and then use your mouse to click within the TouchDesigner window to begin drawing and generating real-time AI imagery and controlling the synthesiser.
